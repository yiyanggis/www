Removes the anchor from the permalinks ("read more"-links), so you don't jump halfway down the page.

== Description ==

Usually when you click a permalink ("read more"-link) to a post, the link contains a "#more-<postid>" at the end, making the browser jump down to the "readmore" mark. You might not want this behaviour, so this plugin removes the anchor from the link. 


== Installation ==
1. Download and unzip plugin
2. Upload the 'remove-more-jump' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory,
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want to remove the jump? =
The user doesn't see the title or the text (s)he just read. This can make the user confused over what actually happened and whether they are on the correct page.


== Screenshots ==

1. Permalink ("read more"-link) without this plugin has the #more-5 anchor
2. Permalink ("read more"-link) with this plugin is clean without anchor
